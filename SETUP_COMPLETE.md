# ‚úÖ Up Banking MCP Server - Setup Complete

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is an unofficial, community-built MCP server and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Up Banking.

## What Was Done

### 1. MCP Server Added to Claude Desktop ‚úì

**Configuration File:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "up-banking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/michaelgall/Development/up-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Server Validation ‚úì

The server was tested and confirmed working:
- ‚úì Starts successfully
- ‚úì Responds to MCP protocol messages
- ‚úì Lists all 4 tools correctly
- ‚úì Connects to Up API
- ‚úì Token authentication working

### 3. Available Tools

Once Claude Desktop is restarted, you'll have access to:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_accounts` | List all your Up bank accounts |
| `get_account` | Get details of a specific account |
| `list_transactions` | List transactions with optional filters |
| `ping` | Test API connectivity |

## Next Steps

### To Start Using the Server:

1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (‚åòQ)
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
3. **Look for the MCP indicator** - You should see "up-banking" connected
4. **Try it out!** Ask Claude questions like:
   - "What are my Up bank accounts?"
   - "Show me my recent transactions"
   - "What's my current balance?"

## Troubleshooting

If the server doesn't appear after restarting:

1. **Check environment variable:**
   ```bash
   launchctl getenv UP_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Set if missing:**
   ```bash
   launchctl setenv UP_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN "your_token"
   ```

3. **Validate config file:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

4. **Test server manually:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michaelgall/Development/up-mcp
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js
   ```
